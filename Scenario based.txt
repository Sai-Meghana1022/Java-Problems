**1. Seating Arrangement in a theater(2D array)

problem:

you are designing a seating arrangement syste for a theate. The theater has n rows and m columns, and you need to create a 2D array to represent the seating arrangement. Each seat is represented as either:

0(empty seat), or
1(occupied seat).

You need to implement the following operations:

-Mark a seat as occupied when a person buys a ticket.
-Find the toal number of seats available.
-Display te seating arragement with occupied and empty seas.

Seating arrangement(5X5 theater):
[0,0,1,0,1]
[1,1,0,0,0]
[0,1,1,0,1]
[1,0,0,1,0]
[0,0,1,0,0]

Operation 1:mark seat(2,2) as occupied.
Operation 2: Count available seats.
Operation 3: Display the seating arrangement.

**2.Sales Data Analysis(3d Array)

Problem:

You are working with sales data for a retail store, and you need to store data for each product across different regions for multiple years. Use a 3D array to represent the folowing data:

Dimension 1: The number of years.
Dimension 2: The number of regions.
Dimension 3: The number of products.
You need to implement the following opetaions:

Store the sales data for each product acros different regions for multiple years.
Calculate the total sales for each product across all years and regions.
Find the region with the highest sales for a specific product.

Example:
Consider the followin 3D array representing sales for 2 years, 3 regions, and 4 products:

Year 1 Sales:
[100,200,150,50] //Region 1 sales for products 1, 2, 3, 4
[120,180,130,70]//Region 2 sales for products 1, 2, 3, 4
[110,210,160,90] //Region 3 sales for products 1, 2, 3, 4

Year 2 Sales:
[150,250,200,90] //Region 1 sales for products 1, 2, 3, 4
[130,220,170,80] //Region 2 sales for products 1, 2, 3, 4
[120,230,190,100] //Region 3 sales for products 1, 2, 3, 4

Calculate the total sales for Product 1 over all regions and years.
Find the region with the highest sales for Product 2 in year 1.

Solution Approach. 
Define a 3D array where the first dimension represents the years, the second represents the regions, and the third repsents the products.
Use loops to traverse trough the 3D array and perform oprations like claculating total and finding maximum sales.
